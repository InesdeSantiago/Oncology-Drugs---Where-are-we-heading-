# oncology drugs

What oncology drugs have been approved to date? How much time and money was spent in their development? How much revenue did they bring? How much OS and PFS did they increase (in absolute months)? How many patients develop resistance? What pathways do they hit and are these pathways the answer to resistant mechanisms (Do we need to hit 2 pathways or different pathways?). How many of these have companion biomarkers? How many patients did not respond to treatment - Is this because of lack of better patient stratification? Should we spend more time on phase I? How many of these drugs could treat accross different cancers - what are the common alterated pathways in different cancers (e.g. HER2 amplification in Lung Cancer)? Should we focus more on earlier stage? If I could fund 10 clinical trials today, how to select them - possibly the ones on earlier stage? or should I fund the later stage? I would choose the drug that would give me more return / or the drug that saves more people?

# How we measure cos-effective drugs

Outcomes for effects are measured in life years (LYs) which represent the average number of years of life per patient. This is measured by the area under the survival curve. LYs are weighted by estimates of health related quality of life represented by ‘utility’ values to produce quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost outcomes are measured as average cost per patient. The final cost- effectiveness outcome measure is the difference in costs divided by the difference in effects (cost per QALY); this is referred to as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). In the UK the threshold ICER for an intervention being cost-effective has been estimated to be up to £30,000. 

# Examples of cost-efficient drugs

The problem with many of oncology drugs is the high cost compared to their benefits. The ratio cost-benefit is not ideal. Few agents have been proven to be cost-effective, such as Gleevec, imatinib (IM), trastuzumab, but other drugs have not (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb1607705).

A particular good example is in Chronic Myeloid Leukimia, Bower et al have shown that a dramatic improvement in the survival of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurred after the introduction of imatinib mesylate, the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). IM is considered a 'personalised drug' because it addresses the underlying cause of CML. In CML there is chromosomal translocation that results in a active tyrosine kinase called BCR-ALBP1. IM targets this oncoprotein. For instance, the life expantacy of a 55-year old male CML patient would be ~3.5years in 1980's but is is  after IM increased by 27.3 years in 2010 (IM was introduced around 2000). Ohm et al (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/10428194.2014.953141?scroll=top&needAccess=true)evaluated clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness, using Swedish registry data based on patients with CML diagnosed 1973–2008. Outcome from three time periods (I: 1973–1979; II: 1991–1997; III: 2002–2008) and concluded that over the past 4 decades there was a dramatically improved survival in CML, paralleled by incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)  levels. Median survival was 1.9, 4.0 and 13 years during the respective time periods. The ICER between periods III and II was €52700 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.

Another cited example is  Trastuzumab (TR). Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is rarely curable at present, although some women live with it for many years; the median overall survival (OS) ranges from 18 to 24 months. Around 25% of over-express HER2. TR is a monoclonal antibody approved by EMA in 2000 and one of the first examples of “targeted therapy”, is indicated to treat HER2 positive breast cancer. Cost-effictive studies don't always agree on the benefit of TR. For instnace, the latest draft guidance on trastuzumab emtansine reverses a previous recommendation issued last December in which NICE said that the drug was too expensive (https://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j2930). The cost of £90 000 (€103 000; $115 000) for an average course of treatment (14.5 months) gives trastuzumab a cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) of £166 000, which was well above the normal threshold for drugs used at the end of life. 

# Costly cancer drugs and treatment failure 

Fojo et al 2014 has investigated FDA-approved oncology thearapies and their limited survival progress against major cancers from 2002 to 2014 (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/1891387?redirect=true ). 71 cancer drugs were approved, 52 were targeted therapies. For 23 drugs only progression free survival (PFS) is available - no Overall survival (OS). The increase of median progression-free survival was of 2.5 months, and overall survival of 2.1 months.
The guidelines to consider survival improvments as 'clinically significant' vary from cancer to cancer. For instance, for pancreatic cancer (where the current OS is 10-14 months), an improvement of 4 months in OS is considered significant. For lung cancer (current survival is 13 months), 3.25 months is considered significant; and for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (survival is 18 months), at least an additional 4.5 months is considered a significant improvment in survival. Only 30 of the 71 cancer drugs meet these guidelines.
Howard et al., 2015 analysed the trends in the launch prices for 58 anticancer drugs approved between 1995 and 2013 by the FDA in the United States. They find that the average launch price of anticancer drugs, adjusted for inflation and health benefits, increased by 10 percent annually—or an average of $8,500 per year—from 1995 to 2013. We paied $54,100 per year of life in 1995, $139,000 in 2005 and $207,00 in 2013 (https://www.elsevier.com/books/realizing-the-promise-of-precision-medicine/cerrato/978-0-12-811635-7)

Median monthly cost of cancer drugs at time of approval by FDA has increased over the years:

Similar findings have been reported regarding EMA. From 2009 to 2013, the EMA approved the use of 48 cancer drugs for 68 indications with a magnitude of the overall survival benefit ranged from 1.0 to 5.8 months (median 2.7 months). (http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/jco.2015.33.15_suppl.e17788). At time of market approval, according to the EPARs, there was significant prolongation of survival in just over a third (24/68, 35%) of all drug indications (including 3/17 drugs to treat haematological malignancies and 21/51 drugs to treat solid tumours). For the 44 (65%) remaining drug indications, there was no conclusive evidence at time of market authorisation that the drugs offered survival benefits, either as add on treatment or compared with placebo or existing treatment options in their authorised use.


# Some cancer drug examples

### Lung Cancer

Crizotinib (trade name Xalkori, Pfizer): Acts as a acting as an ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and ROS1 (c-ros oncogene 1) inhibitor. Approved in March 2016 for ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer

### Skin Cancer

Vismodegib (Erivedge, Genentech/Roche): Erivedge is a pill taken once a day and works by inhibiting the Hedgehog pathway, a pathway that is active in most basal cell cancers and only a few normal tissues, such as hair follicles. Aproved in January 2012 for **metastatic** basal cell carcinoma. 

Vemurafenib (Zelboraf, Roche):  Zelboraf is a BRAF inhibitor that is able to block the function of the V600E-mutated BRAF protein. Zelboraf is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with melanoma whose tumors express a gene mutation called BRAF V600E. Aproved in August 2017 for **late stage** metastatic melanoma.

### Kidney Cancer

Recently approved drugs for the treatment of kidney cancer include sorafenib (2005), sunitinib (2006), temsirolimus (2007), everolimus (2009), bevacizumab (2009) and pazopanib (2009).

Axitinib (Trade name Inlyta, Pfizer).  Inlyta works by blocking certain proteins called kinases that play a role in tumor growth and cancer progression. Aproved for **late stage** renal cell carcinoma in January 2012.

### Bone marrow cancer

Ruxolitinib (trade names Jakafi and Jakavi, Incyte). Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor with selectivity for subtypes JAK1 and JAK2 of this enzyme. Approved for myelofibrosis in February 2016.

### Breast cancer

Trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech). Trastuzumab works by binding to the HER2 receptor and slowing down cell duplication. Trastuzumab was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. Trastuzumab can be used in the treatment of **metastatic** and in **early stage (curable)** HER2-positive breast cancer. Around 20 companies worldwide, particularly from emerging markets, are developing biosimilar versions of the drug 'Herceptin' after Roche/Genentech's patents expired in 2014 in Europe, and in 2019 in the United States.

### Ovarian Cancer

Olaparib (trade name Lynparza, KuDOS/AstraZeneca). It is a PARP inhibitor, inhibiting poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), an enzyme involved in DNA repair.It acts against cancers in people with hereditary BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, which include some ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers. The FDA approval in 2014 is in germline BRCA mutated (gBRCAm) advanced ovarian cancer that has received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy.

### Several cancers

Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech). Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). In 2004 it became the first clinically used angiogenesis inhibitor. Used in several cancers including Colorectal, Brest, Lung, Renal and eye disease

Cabozantinib (Cabometyx,Exelixis Inc). It is a small molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases c-Met and VEGFR2, and has been shown to reduce tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Approved in January 2011. Used to treat **metastatic advanced** prostate cancer (castration-resistant prostate cancer) (2011),  Glioblastoma multiforme and **advanced** clear renal cell carcinoma (2015).

Gemcitabine, sold under the brand name Gemzar among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat a number of types of cancer. This includes breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, and biliary tract cancer.

### Drugs NOT approved for the treatment of cancer

Denosumab (trade names Prolia and Xgeva, Amgen). Denosumab is used in the treatment of osteoporosis. It is a RANKL inhibitor, which works by preventing the development of osteoclasts which are cells that break down bone. Xgeva is the first drug to significantly increase bone metastasis-free survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer, but was not approved by FDA.

Decitabine (trade name Dacogen), or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, acts as an Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitor.It is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Decitabine did not achieve FDA approval for AML, but continues to be used off-label. Current research is focused on further defining subgroups of elderly AML patients who may derive greater benefit from decitabine therapy and combining it with other low-intensity active agents for AML.

Iniparib (from Bipar) was a drug candidate for cancer treatment. It was originally believed to act as an irreversible inhibitor of PARP1 (hence, a PARP inhibitor). It underwent clinical trials for treatment of some types of breast cancer, but was discontinued after phase III clinical trials.
