# oncology drugs

What oncology drugs have been approved to date? How much time and money was spent in their development? How much revenue did they bring? How much OS and PFS did they increase (in absolute months)? How many patients develop resistance? What pathways do they hit and are these pathways the answer to resistant mechanisms (Do we need to hit 2 pathways or different pathways?). How many of these have companion biomarkers? How many patients did not respond to treatment - Is this because of lack of better patient stratification? Should we spend more time on phase I? How many of these drugs could treat accross different cancers - what are the common alterated pathways in different cancers (e.g. HER2 amplification in Lung Cancer)? Should we focus more on earlier stage? If I could fund 10 clinical trials today, how to select them - possibly the ones on earlier stage? or should I fund the later stage? I would choose the drug that would give me more return / or the drug that saves more people? I will depend on earlier detection of cancer - some cancers are detected earlier than others..  

### Lung Cancer

Crizotinib (trade name Xalkori, Pfizer): Acts as a acting as an ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and ROS1 (c-ros oncogene 1) inhibitor. Approved in March 2016 for ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer

### Skin Cancer

Vismodegib (Erivedge, Genentech/Roche): Erivedge is a pill taken once a day and works by inhibiting the Hedgehog pathway, a pathway that is active in most basal cell cancers and only a few normal tissues, such as hair follicles. Aproved in January 2012 for **metastatic** basal cell carcinoma. 

Vemurafenib (Zelboraf, Roche):  Zelboraf is a BRAF inhibitor that is able to block the function of the V600E-mutated BRAF protein. Zelboraf is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with melanoma whose tumors express a gene mutation called BRAF V600E. Aproved in August 2017 for **late stage** metastatic melanoma.

### Kidney Cancer

Recently approved drugs for the treatment of kidney cancer include sorafenib (2005), sunitinib (2006), temsirolimus (2007), everolimus (2009), bevacizumab (2009) and pazopanib (2009).

Axitinib (Trade name Inlyta, Pfizer).  Inlyta works by blocking certain proteins called kinases that play a role in tumor growth and cancer progression. Aproved for **late stage** renal cell carcinoma in January 2012.

### Bone marrow cancer

Ruxolitinib (trade names Jakafi and Jakavi, Incyte). Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor with selectivity for subtypes JAK1 and JAK2 of this enzyme. Approved for myelofibrosis in February 2016.

### Breast cancer

Trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech). Trastuzumab works by binding to the HER2 receptor and slowing down cell duplication. Trastuzumab was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. Trastuzumab can be used in the treatment of **metastatic** and in **early stage (curable)** HER2-positive breast cancer. Around 20 companies worldwide, particularly from emerging markets, are developing biosimilar versions of the drug 'Herceptin' after Roche/Genentech's patents expired in 2014 in Europe, and in 2019 in the United States.

### Ovarian Cancer

Olaparib (trade name Lynparza, KuDOS/AstraZeneca). It is a PARP inhibitor, inhibiting poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), an enzyme involved in DNA repair.It acts against cancers in people with hereditary BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, which include some ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers. The FDA approval in 2014 is in germline BRCA mutated (gBRCAm) advanced ovarian cancer that has received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy.

### Several cancers

Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech). Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). In 2004 it became the first clinically used angiogenesis inhibitor. Used in several cancers including Colorectal, Brest, Lung, Renal and eye disease

Cabozantinib (Cabometyx,Exelixis Inc). It is a small molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases c-Met and VEGFR2, and has been shown to reduce tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Approved in January 2011. Used to treat **metastatic advanced** prostate cancer (castration-resistant prostate cancer) (2011),  Glioblastoma multiforme and **advanced** clear renal cell carcinoma (2015).

Gemcitabine, sold under the brand name Gemzar among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat a number of types of cancer. This includes breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, and biliary tract cancer.

### Drugs NOT approved for the treatment of cancer

Denosumab (trade names Prolia and Xgeva, Amgen). Denosumab is used in the treatment of osteoporosis. It is a RANKL inhibitor, which works by preventing the development of osteoclasts which are cells that break down bone. Xgeva is the first drug to significantly increase bone metastasis-free survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer, but was not approved by FDA.

Decitabine (trade name Dacogen), or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, acts as an Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitor.It is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Decitabine did not achieve FDA approval for AML, but continues to be used off-label. Current research is focused on further defining subgroups of elderly AML patients who may derive greater benefit from decitabine therapy and combining it with other low-intensity active agents for AML.

Iniparib (from Bipar) was a drug candidate for cancer treatment. It was originally believed to act as an irreversible inhibitor of PARP1 (hence, a PARP inhibitor). It underwent clinical trials for treatment of some types of breast cancer, but was discontinued after phase III clinical trials.
